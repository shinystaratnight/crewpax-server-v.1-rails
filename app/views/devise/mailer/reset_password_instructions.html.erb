Hello <%= @resource.name %>!
<br>
<br>
Someone has requested a link to change your password. You can do this through the link below.
<br>
<br>
If not clickable, please copy and paste the address to your browser:
<br>
<br>
<%= link_to "Change my password", edit_user_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token) %>
<br>
<br>
<font color="red">If you didn't request this, please ignore this email.</font>
<br>
<br>
Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.
<br>
<br>
  Thanks for using BCPAX!
